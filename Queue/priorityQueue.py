"""
Since HEAP data strcuture is populary used in priority, refer to heap file
Priority Queue Factory : All elements are based on the priority
Priority queue can be implemented using an array, a linked list, a heap data structure, or a binary search tree.


Complexity
--------------------
Operations	        peek	insert	    delete
Linked List	        O(1)	O(n)	    O(1)
Binary Heap	        O(1)	O(log n)	O(log n)
Binary Search Tree	O(1)	O(log n)	O(log n)
Applications
--------------------
Dijkstra's algorithm
for implementing stack
for load balancing and interrupt handling in an operating system
for data compression in Huffman code
