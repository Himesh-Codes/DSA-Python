Queue Factory 
First In First Out (FIFO) 
Enqueue: Add an element to the end of the queue
Dequeue: Remove an element from the front of the queue
IsEmpty: Check if the queue is empty
IsFull: Check if the queue is full
Peek: Get the value of the front of the queue without removing it

Complexity
--------------------
The complexity of enqueue and dequeue operations in a queue using an array is O(1)
POP : complexity might be O(n) depending on the position of the item to be popped.

Applications
--------------------
CPU scheduling, Disk Scheduling
The queue is used for synchronization. For example: IO Buffers, pipes, file IO, etc
Call Center phone systems use Queues to hold people calling them in order.
