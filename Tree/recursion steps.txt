1. Get simplest scenarios, with all possible angles, and find answer
2. Play around examples and look on answer
3. Relate hard to easy case
4. Find relations and do the recursive code
5. Right code example max path on grid(n,m) = { 1 if n = and m =1
                                                grid(n-1) + grid(m-1)
